I do full stack software development at [Tivix](https://www.tivix.com).
Mainly with Django/python and whatever the coolest Javascript framework is at the moment.
I've worked with Angular and React, but currently I prefer Vue.
These days I'm also trying to get good at Rust.

I'm also obsessed with rock climbing and when I'm not in front of my computer I'm out in the mountains.
