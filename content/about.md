I like to build things and you can find a lot of them on [github](https://www.github.com/brleinad).
Mainly with Python, Django and some Javascript framework.
I've worked with Angular and React, but right now I prefer Vue.

During the day I do full stack software development at [Tivix](https://www.tivix.com).
These days I'm also trying to get good at Rust and trying to contribute more to open source.

I'm also obsessed with rock climbing and when I'm not in front of my computer I'm out in the mountains.
Oh yeah and my name is Daniel.

This site is just a collection of things that I find useful for myself, and I thought could be useful for others too.
