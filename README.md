This site uses the [zola](https://www.getzola.org/) static site generator and 
the [sam](https://github.com/janbaudisch/zola-sam) theme.


## Running locally
First make sure you [install zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/)

Then run:
```
zola serve
```


## Deploy to Netlify

There's already a `netlify.toml` so just makes sure to set the `base_url` in the `config.toml` and you should
be good to go to deploy.
